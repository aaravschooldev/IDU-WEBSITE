      <p>Plastic pollution is a serious problem that affects our oceans, wildlife, and the health of our planet. It is estimated that there are currently more than 5 trillion pieces of plastic floating in the world's oceans. To help raise awareness about this issue, we are committed to providing education and resources to help individuals reduce their plastic usage and make a positive impact on the environment.</p>
      <p>Here are some simple steps you can take to reduce your plastic usage:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bring your own reusable bags, water bottles, and coffee cups</li>
        <li>Say no to plastic straws and utensils</li>
        <li>Choose products with minimal packaging or packaging made from recycled materials</li>
        <li>Recycle properly and educate yourself about what can and cannot be recycled in your area</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Join us in making a difference and raising awareness about the importance of reducing plastic usage.</p>
