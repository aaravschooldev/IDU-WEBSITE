      <p>Plastic waste, or is the accumulation of plastic objects (e.g.: plastic bottles and much more) in the Earth’s environment that adversely affects wildlife, wildlife habitat, and humans.’​

        most of what we consume is made of plastic (such as plastic bottles and food containers).​
        
         However, plastic is slow to degrade (taking over 400 years or more) due to its chemical structure, which presents a huge challenge.​
         Micro plastics may pollute drinking water, accumulate in the food chain, and release toxic chemicals that may cause disease, including certain cancers.​

         Micro/nano-plastics may pose acute toxicity, (sub) chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and developmental toxicity.​
        
        Humans may experience oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, neurotoxicity, immune system disruption, and transfer of Micro plastics to other tissues after being exposed to them.​
        
         The toxic effects of Micro plastics in both fish and human are still unknown.​
